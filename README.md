# react-native-safe-area-view

_You are reading the README for 1.0.0-alpha! Unless you intend to be here, you should probably just read the README from the master branch_

This library provides automatic padding when a view intersects with a safe area (notch, status bar, home indicator).

## Installation

```
yarn add react-native-safe-area-view react-native-safe-area-context

# or if you use npm
npm install react-native-safe-area-view react-native-safe-area-context
```

## Usage

First you need to wrap the root of your app with the `SafeAreaProvider`.

**Note:** If you are using react-navigation@>=4 this will be done for you &mdash; you do not need to add the `SafeAreaProvider` in that case.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';
import MyAwesomeApp from './src/MyAwesomeApp';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <MyAwesomeApp />
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  );
}
```

Now you can wrap components that touch any edge of the screen with a `SafeAreaView`.

```jsx
import SafeAreaView from 'react-native-safe-area-view';

export default function MyAwesomeApp() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <Text>
          Look, I'm safe! Not under a status bar or notch or home indicator or
          anything! Very cool
        </Text>
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

### forceInset

Sometimes you will observe unexpected behavior and jank because SafeAreaView uses `onLayout` then calls `measureInWindow` on the view. If you know your view will touch certain edges, use `forceInset` to force it to apply the inset padding on the view.

```jsx
<SafeAreaView forceInset={{ top: 'always' }}>
  <View>
    <Text>Yeah, I'm safe too!</Text>
  </View>
</SafeAreaView>
```

`forceInset` takes an object with the keys `top | bottom | left | right | vertical | horizontal` and the values `'always' | 'never'`. Or you can override the padding altogether by passing an integer.

### Accessing safe area inset values

Sometimes it's useful to know what the insets are for the top, right, bottom, and left of the screen. See the documentation for [react-native-safe-area-context](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context) for more information.
